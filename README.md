# ‚úèÔ∏è Bun-Todos

This is a fun project for beginners who are wising to get started with **Next Js** with **Bun, Zod, TailwindCSS, Kinde and MongoDB**. In This Course We are going to build a fullstack **_todo list_** where a user can perform all kinds of **CRUD** Operations with its todo.

## Quick Start üöÄ

I have created an amzing ui for you to get started, you can use this templete whenever you need it, you have to simply **fork/clone** this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/ScreenTechnicals/bun-todos.git
```

**üçÅ All the required packages has been installed!**

## Kinde Authentication

Open These üëá :

- ‚úÖ [Kinde](https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/nextjs-sdk)
- ‚úÖ [Kinde Next JS 13 App Router Docs](https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/nextjs-sdk)

## Manual Installation & Setup

1. Install Bun in your system(Mac/Linux/Windows SubSystem in Linux(WSL)):

   ```
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```

   If you are on mac or linux it will show you the command to congiure it to the path.

   Now you can run **`bun`** in your terminal to check bun is working or not!

2. Configure Your Next App:

   If **Bun** is installed and configured in your system successfully you can run this command to initialize your **next app**:

   ```
    bun c next-app@latest bun-todos
   ```

   OR

   If **Bun** is **not** installed and configured in your system, then you can use **`yarn or npm`** to initialize your **next app**:

   ```
    npx create-next-app@latest bun-todos
   ```

   ```
    yarn create next-app@latest bun-todos
   ```

## Lockfiles

1. **bun.lockb**

   Running **`bun install`** will create a binary lockfile called **`bun.lockb`**.

2. **yarn.lock**

   Generate a human readable lockfile **`bun install --yarn`**
